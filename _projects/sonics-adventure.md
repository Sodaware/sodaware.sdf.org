  Source code for the first game I ever developed - Sonic's Adventure
---

This is the first game I ever wrote by myself. It's a text adventure starring
Sonic the Hedgehog.

It was written in Power Basic for the Atari ST. The source code is extremely
scrappy and has some wonderfully useless comments and variable names.
