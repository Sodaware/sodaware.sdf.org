description:
  A Protean IDE plugin that provides a simple task list from comments in code.

This plugin scans source files for tags such as "TODO:", and then sticks them in
a dockable list. Really simple, but quite useful when working on big projects.

Protean was an IDE for the Blitz family of languages. I liked it.
