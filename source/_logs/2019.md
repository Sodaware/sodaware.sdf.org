## 2019-09-16

* Move LispMax's `list` function into the core (BitzMax part). Was previously
  using one written in lispmax itself `(foldr cons nil items)`, which is over
  100 times slower than doing it within BlitzMax. There's always overhead when
  using a scripting language vs native, but `list` is a pretty fundamental
  function so it needs to be as fast as possible.

## 2019-09-15

* Update security headers on philnewton.net to include `Feature-Policy`,
  `Referrer-Policy` and `Content-Security-Policy`. The CSP took the longest to
  get working as the syntax highlighting library I'm using was packed and used
  `eval` to unpack (which I have blocked). There's also few inline scripts that
  needed hashes generating - thankfully Chrome will show these in the dev
  console.

## 2019-09-02

* Switched [philnewton.net](https://www.philnewton.net/) to a new server. The
  site is now rebuilt on the server every hour or when files are pushed to git.

## 2019-05-30

* Rebuilt `sodaware.blitzmax_array` to use array slices instead of copying
  things with a `for...next` loop. Much faster and shortens the code
  considerably. Refactoring is much, much simpler with unit tests.

## 2019-05-27

* Fixed bug in blam when creating zip files. Added files did not have the
  correct date info set, so were always showing as being created in 1970.

## 2019-05-24

* Released [maxcop](https://www.sodaware.net/maxcop/) version 0.1.0.

## 2019-05-23

* Fixed another security hole in TSS. Wasn't escaping search queries so it was
  vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## 2019-05-21

* Fixed a bug with blitzmax-mode indentation. Was not indenting
  `Repeat...Forever` loops correctly. And it was treating `Forever` keyword as
  the start of a `For...Next` loop. Oops.

## 2019-05-02

* Fixed a tiny bug in [jekyll-archive-page](https://github.com/sodaware/jekyll-archive-page).

## 2019-04-25

* Set up borg using [borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/). Backups are run
  hourly using cron.

## 2019-04-22

* Started work on setting up my PC with automated backups using borg. Using
  [borgbase](https://borgbase.com/) for storage. Backblaze b2 is cheaper for
  storage, but borgbase is tailored to work with borg and was a bit smoother to
  set up.

## 2019-04-17

* Added missing "[The Printable CEO](https://www.philnewton.net/blog/the-printable-ceo/)" post to
  philnewton.net.

## 2019-04-15

* Created an elisp function to insert new log entries into these files. [See
  note](/notes/elisp-log-entries/).

## 2019-04-14

* Converted [shining-online.co.uk](http://www.shining-online.co.uk/) to be
  provisioned and setup using Ansible. It's far, far too much for a single site
  like this, but it's good practice.

## 2019-04-13

* Created some simple elisp for creating new notes for this site. Probably won't
  save me time in the long-run, but it was fun to implement.

## 2019-04-11

* Rewrote scm_log plugin to meet WordPress standards (and actually escape data)
* Fixed a pretty serious security flaw when sending a `Location` header but not
  exiting the script, so non-authenticated users could still submit data. Pretty
  embarassing.

## 2019-03-03

* Released new version of [garlic_spy](https://garlicspy.com/) with IFTTT.com
  integration.
* Created a status page for Garlic Spy. Ugly code, but it checks for running
  processes and validates the chain state.

## 2019-02-16

* Fixed a really (*really*) [small bug in bmk](https://github.com/bmx-ng/bmk/pull/63).

## 2019-01-09

* Created a hub for my [2019 Groundhog Day](https://www.philnewton.net/bits/2019/) resolutions.
