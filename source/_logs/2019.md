## 2019-04-14

* Converted [shining-online.co.uk](http://www.shining-online.co.uk/) to be
  provisioned and setup using Ansible. It's far, far too much for a single site
  like this, but it's good practice.

## 2019-04-13

* Created some simple elisp for creating new notes for this site. Probably won't
  save me time in the long-run, but it was fun to implement.

## 2019-04-11

* Rewrote scm_log plugin to meet WordPress standards (and actually escape data)
* Fixed a pretty serious security flaw when sending a `Location` header but not
  exiting the script, so non-authenticated users could still submit data. Pretty
  embarassing.

## 2019-03-03

* Released new version of [garlic_spy](https://garlicspy.com/) with IFTTT.com
  integration.
* Created a status page for Garlic Spy. Ugly code, but it checks for running
  processes and validates the chain state.

## 2019-02-16

* Fixed a really (*really*) [small bug in bmk](https://github.com/bmx-ng/bmk/pull/63).

## 2019-01-09

* Created a hub for my [2019 Groundhog Day](https://www.philnewton.net/bits/2019/) resolutions.
