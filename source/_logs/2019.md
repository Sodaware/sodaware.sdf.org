## 2019-05-24

* Released [maxcop](https://www.sodaware.net/maxcop/) version 0.1.0.

## 2019-05-23

* Fixed another security hole in TSS. Wasn't escaping search queries so it was
  vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## 2019-05-21

* Fixed a bug with blitzmax-mode indentation. Was not indenting
  `Repeat...Forever` loops correctly. And it was treating `Forever` keyword as
  the start of a `For...Next` loop. Oops.

## 2019-05-02

* Fixed a tiny bug in [jekyll-archive-page](https://github.com/sodaware/jekyll-archive-page).

## 2019-04-25

* Set up borg using [borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/). Backups are run
  hourly using cron.

## 2019-04-22

* Started work on setting up my PC with automated backups using borg. Using
  [borgbase](https://borgbase.com/) for storage. Backblaze b2 is cheaper for
  storage, but borgbase is tailored to work with borg and was a bit smoother to
  set up.

## 2019-04-17

* Added missing "[The Printable CEO](https://www.philnewton.net/blog/the-printable-ceo/)" post to
  philnewton.net.

## 2019-04-15

* Created an elisp function to insert new log entries into these files. [See
  note](/notes/elisp-log-entries/).

## 2019-04-14

* Converted [shining-online.co.uk](http://www.shining-online.co.uk/) to be
  provisioned and setup using Ansible. It's far, far too much for a single site
  like this, but it's good practice.

## 2019-04-13

* Created some simple elisp for creating new notes for this site. Probably won't
  save me time in the long-run, but it was fun to implement.

## 2019-04-11

* Rewrote scm_log plugin to meet WordPress standards (and actually escape data)
* Fixed a pretty serious security flaw when sending a `Location` header but not
  exiting the script, so non-authenticated users could still submit data. Pretty
  embarassing.

## 2019-03-03

* Released new version of [garlic_spy](https://garlicspy.com/) with IFTTT.com
  integration.
* Created a status page for Garlic Spy. Ugly code, but it checks for running
  processes and validates the chain state.

## 2019-02-16

* Fixed a really (*really*) [small bug in bmk](https://github.com/bmx-ng/bmk/pull/63).

## 2019-01-09

* Created a hub for my [2019 Groundhog Day](https://www.philnewton.net/bits/2019/) resolutions.
