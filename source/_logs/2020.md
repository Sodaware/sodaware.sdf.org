## 2020-04-15

* Added comment support to blitzmax-mode, so it can now use `comment-region`
  etc.

## 2020-03-10

* blitzmax-mode is now on Melpa.

## 2020-01-23

* Added schema.org markup to [sodaware.net](https://www.sodaware.net/) game
  pages.

## 2020-01-12

* Rebuilt all of the [sodaware.net](https://www.sodaware.net/) game pages to use
  yaml data instead of manualy adding html to the page. Should make adding new
  games easier, assuming I ever get around to doing that.

## 2020-01-06

* Wrote a little tool in Ruby using [Watir](http://watir.com/) to scrape game
  info from BMT Micro. Couldn't use my usual method of curl as the pages are
  built using JS. Watir can call a headless browser and then save the content as
  a html file. Pretty neat.
