## 2018-04-13

* Released an updated version of
  [beeminder.el](https://github.com/sodaware/beeminder.el/). Much cleaner
  internals and the groundwork is laid for some new features.

* Finally added filter chains to [blam](https://www.sodaware.net/blam/) which
  make it possible to modify the contents of a file during copy operations. They
  can be used to insert the current date into a source file, or to strip
  whitespace etc.

* Made some big improvements to [blitzmax-mode](/projects/blitzmax-mode/). Now
  supports automatic indentation, syntax highlighting, multi-line comments and
  more.

* Released "[garlic_spy](https://garlicspy.com/)", a really simple API for
  querying the garlicoin blockchain. Tried out two new pieces of tech - ansible
  and mina. Worked pretty well.
