  MaxCop is a work-in-progress attempt at a BlitzMax source code checker.

MaxCop is a simple command-line tool for finding BlitzMax formatting
issues. It's similar to tools like [RuboCop](https://www.rubocop.org/), but not
as good.

It can currently scan for 15 different rule violations, mostly around Type
sizing and member names. Eventually I'd like to integrate it into Emacs so code
issues can be underlined.
