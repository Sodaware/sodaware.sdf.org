  An Emacs library for working with the (now defunct) bter.com API.
---

**beter-api** is an Emacs library for working with the Bter API. Bter.com was a
Bitcoin and crypto-currency exchange platform.

**bter.com has closed, so this library is no longer functional**

It's not a particularly useful extension on its own, but can be used to build
something more interesting.
