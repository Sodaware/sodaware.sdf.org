  An ActionScript (AS3) port of the Artemis framework, an entity-component
  system for game development
---

**Apollo** is an entity/component framework for ActionScript. Instead of building
your game objects from class heirarchies, Apollo lets you build them with
components and systems.

I was too lazy to write an examples when it was first released. Lesson learned.


## What it isn't

It's not a replacement for things like Flixel or Flashpunk. They take care of
the stuff people see, Apollo does the "behind the scenes".


## Further Reading

Entity systems are a big topic. The following places have lots of information on
them:

  * [Entity Systems Wiki](http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/)
  * [Adam Martin's Blog](http://t-machine.org)
  * [The Components and Systems of Morgan's Raid](http://paulgestwicki.blogspot.com/2012/03/components-and-systems-of-morgans-raid.html)
  
  
Want some examples? Here are some open source projects (mostly written with
Artemis) that you can learn from:

## Thanks

Apollo is based on the Artemis framework by [Gamadu](http://gamadu.com), along
with improvements made by [GemSerk](https://github.com/gemserk/artemis).
