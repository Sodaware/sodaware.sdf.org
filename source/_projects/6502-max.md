  A 6502 simulator written in BlitzMax.

I started writing this at the end of 2018 to learn a little more about 6502
machine code and how it all fits together. I never got around to finishing it,
so set it as a goal for 2019.

The following code (once assembled) runs correctly...

```
loop: LDA $FE
      STA $00
      LDA $FE
      AND #$3
      CLC
      ADC #$2
      STA $01
      LDA $FE
      LDY #$0
      STA ($00),Y
      JMP LOOP
```

..and produces this wonderful screen:

It still needs unit testing thoroughly, mostly to check various flags work
correctly, but it's functional enough for now. Eventually I'd like to add some
debugging commands for stepping through functions and examining memory.
