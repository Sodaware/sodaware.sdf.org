  A game framework written in BlitzMax.

I've written a lot of code in BlitzMax. **Pangolin** is an attempt at making a
game framework.

So far I've used it for the following games:

* [Mini Shinobi](https://www.sodaware.net/1gam-2017/01-mini-shinobi/)
* [Splodey Boats 2000](https://www.sodaware.net/1gam-2017/02-splodey-boats/)
