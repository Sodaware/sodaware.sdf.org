[Paredit](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit) is an Emacs extension for
working with parenthesis and S-expressions.

From the ParEdit page:

> ParEdit (paredit.el) is a minor mode for performing structured editing of
> S-expression data. The typical example of this would be Lisp or Scheme source
> code.
>
> ParEdit helps **keep parentheses balanced** and adds many keys for moving
> S-expressions and moving around in S-expressions.

Seeing it in action makes it much clearer how useful it is. Here's two great
visual guides to ParEdit and what it can do:

1. [Emacs Rocks! Paredit](http://emacsrocks.com/e14.html)
2. [The Animated Guide to Paredit](http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html)

Like most things Emacs, it takes a while to get used to. But once over the initial
learning curve it's indespensible.
