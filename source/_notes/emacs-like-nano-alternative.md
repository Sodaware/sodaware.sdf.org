Although Emacs is my primary editor 99% of the time, I still use `nano` when I
need to edit something quickly (and especially if I need root priveleges).

I recently found out about [zile](https://www.gnu.org/software/zile/), an
extremely lightweight editor that uses Emacs key-bindings and has a similar
buffer mode.

It's not a replacement for Emacs, but it does support scripting and is a decent
alternative to nano.
